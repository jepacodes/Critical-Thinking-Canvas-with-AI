# Example: Learning a New Domain

This example shows how to use the framework when you're learning something outside your expertise, not applying existing knowledge.

---

## The Context

**Who:** Sam, a software engineer transitioning to a product management role

**The task:** Understand the company's pricing strategy well enough to contribute to pricing discussions

**Why it matters:** Sam will be responsible for features that affect pricing. Making good decisions requires understanding the pricing philosophy, not just the current numbers.

---

## AI Decision Canvas

### Question 1: Material Engagement

**Honest assessment:** I'm tempted to just ask AI to explain our pricing strategy. But then I'd only know what AI told me—I wouldn't actually understand it.

**Checked boxes:**

- [x] **I will read/analyze source documents myself**
  
  *I'll read the original pricing documentation, not summaries. I'll look at the actual pricing models, not just descriptions of them.*

- [x] **I will make key decisions myself**
  
  *Not applicable yet—I'm learning, not deciding. But I'll form my own opinions about what makes sense.*

- [x] **I will create something original**
  
  *I'll write my own summary of how our pricing works. If I can't explain it without looking things up, I don't understand it.*

- [x] **AI is a supplement, not a substitute**
  
  *AI will help me understand what I'm reading, not replace the reading.*

**Status:** ✓ Can proceed

---

### Question 2: Productive Resistance

**Honest assessment:** When learning something new, I often just accept explanations that sound reasonable. I need to push harder.

**Checked boxes:**

- [x] **AI will raise alternatives, not just confirm ideas**
  
  *I'll ask AI: "What are other ways companies price similar products? Why might those approaches be better or worse?"*

- [x] **AI will identify potential fallacies/blind spots**
  
  *I'll share my understanding and ask AI what I'm probably getting wrong.*

- [x] **I will think critically about AI output**
  
  *Since this is outside my expertise, I'll verify AI explanations against primary sources when possible.*

- [x] **I can confidently reject AI suggestions**
  
  *I'll cross-reference with actual company documentation. If AI says something that contradicts our docs, I'll trust the docs.*

**Status:** ✓ Can proceed

---

### Question 3: Metacognition

**Honest assessment:** I need to pay attention to what's actually sticking versus what I'm just nodding along to.

**Checked boxes:**

- [x] **I'm aware of why I accept/reject suggestions**
  
  *I'll keep notes on what I don't understand and what I'm taking on faith.*

- [x] **I understand my own reasoning process**
  
  *I'll periodically explain concepts out loud (or in writing) to test whether I actually know them.*

- [x] **I'm learning about my own judgment**
  
  *I'll track where my intuitions were right vs. wrong as I learn more.*

- [x] **I can articulate how I think about my domain**
  
  *Goal: by the end, I should be able to explain our pricing philosophy to a new hire.*

**Status:** ✓ Can proceed

## Task Analysis Canvas

### What's the Goal?

Understand our pricing strategy deeply enough to:
- Contribute meaningfully to pricing discussions
- Identify when a feature decision has pricing implications
- Explain the philosophy to others, not just the numbers
- Notice when something doesn't fit the strategy

**Not** the goal: Become a pricing expert. I just need to be competent.

---

### What Materials Do I Need?

**Primary sources (must engage with directly):**
- Pricing philosophy doc from the strategy team
- Current pricing page and all the nuances
- Internal FAQ on pricing decisions
- Last 3 pricing decision memos (to see how decisions get made)
- Customer feedback on pricing (from support and sales)

**Secondary sources (for context):**
- Industry pricing benchmarks
- Competitor pricing analysis
- Books/articles on SaaS pricing (for concepts)

---

### What Decisions Must I Make?

This is a learning task, so not decisions—but judgment calls:
- Which concepts are most important for my role?
- What level of depth do I need?
- What can I learn over time vs. what do I need now?
- When is my understanding "good enough"?

---

### My Value Add

*This is tricky—I'm the learner here, not the expert. But:*
- I have software engineering context that informs how features affect pricing
- I understand technical constraints on pricing implementation
- I can bring a fresh perspective (sometimes expertise creates blind spots)

---

### Domain Assessment

**This is OUTSIDE my domain.** I know software; I don't know pricing strategy.

Implications:
- I need to engage more heavily with source materials
- I should be skeptical of my own quick understanding—it's probably incomplete
- I need to verify AI explanations against actual company documentation
- I should talk to people with real expertise, not just AI

---

## Strategic Engagement Canvas

### Deep Engagement (Red)

*Where I do the core thinking:*

- Reading the pricing philosophy doc—multiple times if needed
- Understanding *why* we price the way we do, not just how
- Working through the logic of specific pricing decisions
- Writing my own explanation of how our pricing works

### Moderate Engagement (Yellow)

*Collaborative work with AI support:*

- Understanding pricing concepts I'm unfamiliar with (AI as tutor)
- Comparing our approach to alternatives
- Identifying questions to ask the pricing team
- Testing my understanding by explaining to AI

### Light Engagement (Green)

*AI handles more:*

- Gathering background on pricing models
- Finding articles and resources
- Answering quick definitional questions

---

### AI Guardrails

**What AI Should Do:**
- Explain concepts I don't understand
- Give examples that illustrate abstract ideas
- Point out when my understanding seems incomplete
- Suggest questions I should be asking

**What AI Should NOT Do:**
- Be my only source (I need to verify with actual docs)
- Give me summaries instead of making me read originals
- Tell me I understand when I'm just repeating back
- Replace conversations with actual experts

---

## Thought Architecture Canvas

### Learning Outline

```
Core concepts I need to understand:
1. Value-based pricing philosophy
   - What is it?
   - Why did we choose it?
   - How does it affect specific decisions?

2. Our pricing model mechanics
   - Tiers and what's in each
   - How features map to tiers
   - How add-ons work

3. Pricing decision process
   - Who decides?
   - What factors matter?
   - How are trade-offs made?

4. Connection to product
   - How feature decisions affect pricing
   - What I need to watch for in my role

5. Common mistakes / edge cases
   - What goes wrong?
   - What's counterintuitive?
```

---

### Source Grounding

**Pricing Philosophy Doc (key points I'm extracting myself):**
- Core principle: price reflects value delivered, not cost to produce
- Implication: features go in tiers based on which customers get most value from them
- Key insight: enterprise customers value [X] more than SMB customers

**Decision Memo from Q3:**
- They moved feature Y from Basic to Pro tier
- Reasoning: usage data showed it's primarily used by power users
- Customer feedback: some complaints, but churn didn't spike

**Conversation with pricing lead:**
- "The thing most people get wrong is thinking about features in isolation. It's about the package."
- "When in doubt, default to putting new features in higher tiers. It's easier to move down than up."

### Understanding Check

*Testing myself: Can I explain these concepts without looking them up?*

| Concept | Can I explain it? | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Value-based pricing | Sort of | I get the idea but can't articulate why we chose it over alternatives |
| Tier logic | Yes | I understand why features go where they go |
| Add-on strategy | No | Need to study this more |
| Decision process | Partially | I know who's involved but not how trade-offs are made |

*Identified gaps: Add-on strategy and decision trade-offs need more work.*

---

### Decision Log

*Tracking my learning process:*

| Topic | AI explanation | Verified against? | Confidence |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| Value-based vs. cost-plus pricing | AI explained the difference | Checked against pricing book chapter | High—matches |
| Our tier structure | AI summarized from our docs | Read the actual docs myself | High—accurate |
| Why feature X is in Pro tier | AI guessed based on features | Asked pricing lead | Medium—AI was partially right |
| Enterprise pricing negotiations | AI made general statements | Haven't verified yet | Low—need to check |

---

### Questions for Experts

*What I can't learn from AI or docs—need to ask humans:*

1. What's the most common mistake PMs make on pricing?
2. When should I involve the pricing team vs. use my judgment?
3. Are there any features that were mis-tiered? What happened?
4. What's the process when a customer pushes back hard on pricing?

---

## Authenticity Review Canvas

### Learning Check (adapted for learning tasks)

- [x] **Can I explain the core concepts?** Mostly. I have gaps on add-ons and decision trade-offs that I've identified for follow-up.

- [x] **Is my understanding genuine?** Yes—I've tested it by trying to explain things myself and noticing where I struggle.

- [x] **Could I use this knowledge?** For basic decisions, yes. For complex ones, I know when to ask for help.

- [x] **Did I actually learn?** Yes. I understand things I didn't before. My mental model of pricing has changed.

- [x] **Could I explain this without AI?** The core concepts, yes. For details, I know where to look.

### Red Flag Check

- [ ] **Just memorizing AI explanations?** No. I verified against primary sources and formed my own understanding.

- [ ] **Skipped the hard parts?** No. I read the original philosophy doc even though it was dense.

- [ ] **Confused familiarity with understanding?** Caught myself doing this on add-ons. That's why I marked it as a gap.

- [ ] **Relying on AI for things I should know?** No. I'm building real knowledge, just using AI as a tutor.

*One near-miss: I was about to say I understood add-ons, but when I tried to explain the strategy, I couldn't. Honest self-assessment caught it.*

---

## Final Reflection

**What worked:**
- Reading the primary docs myself, then using AI to fill in gaps
- Testing my understanding by trying to explain things
- Keeping a list of what I don't understand instead of pretending I do
- Identifying questions that require talking to actual experts

**What was hard:**
- The pricing philosophy doc was dense. I read it three times before it clicked.
- Resisting the urge to just accept AI explanations and move on
- Being honest about what I don't actually understand

**What I learned about learning:**
- AI is a good tutor but not a substitute for engaging with material
- Testing yourself constantly is the only way to know if you really get it
- Talking to experts is still necessary—AI generalizes, experts know the specifics

**Next steps:**
- Schedule conversations with pricing lead on my outstanding questions
- Revisit add-on strategy after those conversations
- Sit in on the next pricing decision meeting to see how it works in practice

**How I'll know I've succeeded:**
- I can contribute meaningfully to a pricing discussion without feeling like an imposter
- I catch a feature decision that has pricing implications before someone else points it out
- A new hire asks me about pricing and I can explain it coherently

## Learning Artifact

*My own summary of how our pricing works (written without looking at notes):*

We use value-based pricing—the idea is that the price should reflect the value a customer gets, not what it costs us to provide. This means features go in tiers based on who gets the most value from them, not how complex they were to build.

Our tiers are Basic, Pro, and Enterprise. Basic is for individual users and small teams who need core functionality. Pro adds features that power users and growing teams value—things like [X], [Y], and [Z]. Enterprise has features that large organizations need for compliance, security, and scale.

When deciding where a feature goes, the question is: which customers will value this most? If it's something everyone needs, it goes in Basic. If it enables power-user workflows, Pro. If it's table stakes for large companies but overkill for small ones, Enterprise.

The thing I'm still learning is the add-on strategy and how pricing negotiations work for enterprise deals. That's my next focus area.

*This feels like real understanding. I wrote it without looking at the docs, and I can point to where my knowledge is solid vs. incomplete. That's the goal.*
