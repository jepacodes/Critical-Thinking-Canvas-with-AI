# Example: Writing a Strategy Memo

This example shows how someone worked through the framework for a real task. It includes the actual thinking process, not just the final answers.

---

## The Context

**Who:** Alex, a strategy analyst at a mid-sized tech company

**The task:** Write a memo recommending whether to enter a new market segment (enterprise customers)

**Why it matters:** This memo will influence a major strategic decision. Wrong recommendation could waste months of effort and millions of dollars.

## AI Decision Canvas

### Question 1: Material Engagement

**Honest assessment:** I was about to ask AI to analyze our competitor data and draft the recommendation. That would skip the actual thinking.

**Checked boxes:**

- [x] **I will still read/analyze source documents myself**
  
  *I'll read the competitor analysis, customer interviews, and financial projections myself. AI won't summarize these for me—I need to form my own impressions.*

- [x] **I will make key decisions myself**
  
  *The actual recommendation—enter or don't enter—has to come from my judgment. I know things about our company that AI doesn't.*

- [x] **I will create something original**
  
  *The memo structure and core argument will be mine. AI might help with specific sections, but the reasoning is mine.*

- [x] **AI is a supplement, not a substitute**
  
  *AI will help me test my reasoning and find gaps, not do the analysis for me.*

**Status:** ✓ Can proceed

---

### Question 2: Productive Resistance

**Honest assessment:** My boss is already leaning toward "yes, enter the market." There's pressure to confirm that. I need AI to push back, not validate.

**Checked boxes:**

- [x] **AI will raise alternatives, not just confirm ideas**
  
  *I'll specifically ask AI: "What are the strongest arguments AGAINST entering this market?" I need the counter-case.*

- [x] **AI will identify potential fallacies/blind spots**
  
  *I'll share my reasoning and ask AI to find holes. "What am I probably underweighting?"*

- [x] **I will need to think critically about AI output**
  
  *AI will give me challenges; I'll need to evaluate whether they're relevant to our specific situation.*

- [x] **I can confidently reject AI suggestions**
  
  *If AI raises concerns that don't apply to us, I'll explain why and move on.*

**Status:** ✓ Can proceed

---

### Question 3: Metacognition

**Honest assessment:** This is where I often slip. I get into flow reviewing AI output and stop noticing my own thinking.

**Checked boxes:**

- [x] **I'm aware of why I accept/reject suggestions**
  
  *I'll keep a decision log. For each major AI suggestion, I'll write why I accepted or rejected it.*

- [x] **I understand my own reasoning process**
  
  *Building the outline myself first will force me to articulate my logic.*

- [x] **I'm learning about my own judgment**
  
  *I'll notice where my initial instincts were wrong—that's how I get better at this.*

- [x] **I can articulate how I think about my domain**
  
  *By the end, I should be able to explain my recommendation without notes.*

**Status:** ✓ Can proceed

---

### Overall Assessment

*All three questions are YES. Proceeding with the approach outlined below.*

## Task Analysis Canvas

### What's the Goal?

Give the leadership team a clear recommendation on whether to pursue enterprise customers, with enough reasoning that they can make an informed decision. They should finish reading understanding:
- What the opportunity actually is (not hype)
- What it would take to succeed
- What the risks are
- Why I recommend what I recommend

This isn't about telling them what they want to hear. It's about giving them the truth as best I can determine it.

---

### What Materials Do I Need?

**Primary sources (must read myself):**
- Customer interview transcripts (12 interviews with enterprise prospects)
- Competitor analysis from product team
- Financial projections from finance
- Our product capability assessment vs. enterprise requirements

**Secondary sources (can skim with AI assistance):**
- Industry analyst reports on enterprise segment
- Case studies of other companies entering this space
- Historical data on our previous market expansions

---

### What Decisions Must I Make?

1. **Is the opportunity real?** The data could be interpreted multiple ways. I need to form a judgment.

2. **Can we actually compete?** Our product has gaps. Are they fixable or fatal?

3. **Is the timing right?** Maybe this is a good opportunity for someone else, just not for us right now.

4. **What's my recommendation?** Enter, don't enter, or something in between (pilot, partnership, etc.)

5. **How confident am I?** What would change my mind?

---

### My Value Add

- I know our company's actual execution capacity (not what we say, what we do)
- I've seen three previous expansion attempts—I know the patterns
- I have relationships with the people who did the customer interviews and can probe beyond the transcripts
- I understand the political context—who wants this to succeed, who's skeptical
- I've been in strategy long enough to recognize wishful thinking in projections

---

### Domain Assessment

**This is in my domain.** I've done this type of analysis for years.

Implications:
- I should trust my judgment over AI's on company-specific factors
- AI is useful for challenging my reasoning and finding blind spots
- I should be skeptical if AI suggests something that contradicts my experience

---

## Strategic Engagement Canvas

### Deep Engagement (Red)

*Where I do the core thinking:*

- Reading all 12 customer interview transcripts
- Forming my initial thesis about the opportunity
- Evaluating our product capability gaps
- Making the final recommendation
- Writing the executive summary and recommendation section

### Moderate Engagement (Yellow)

*Collaborative work with AI support:*

- Analyzing what competitors are doing (I'll review, AI helps synthesize)
- Stress-testing my reasoning (AI plays devil's advocate)
- Finding historical parallels (AI research, I evaluate relevance)
- Identifying risks I might be underweighting

### Light Engagement (Green)

*AI handles more:*

- Formatting the final memo
- Generating financial tables from my inputs
- Checking consistency and flow
- Polishing language

---

### AI Guardrails

**What AI Should Do:**
- Challenge my assumptions with specific evidence
- Find counter-examples to my thesis
- Point out where my reasoning is weak
- Help me see the perspective of people who disagree with my conclusion

**What AI Should NOT Do:**
- Summarize the customer interviews (I need to read those myself)
- Make the recommendation (that's my job)
- Write the core argument without my direction
- Tell me my reasoning is good when it's not

---

## Thought Architecture Canvas

### Outline (Built Before AI)

```
1. Executive Summary
   - The opportunity: [what it actually is]
   - My recommendation: [clear position]
   - Key reason: [the one thing that matters most]
   - What we'd need to do: [high-level requirements]

2. The Opportunity
   - Market size and dynamics
   - What enterprise customers actually want
   - Why they might buy from us
   
3. The Challenges
   - Product gaps
   - Sales motion changes required
   - Competitive positioning
   
4. Risk Assessment
   - What could go wrong
   - What we don't know
   - Downside scenarios
   
5. Recommendation
   - My conclusion
   - What would change my mind
   - Suggested next steps
```

### Source Grounding

**Customer interview insights:**
- 8 of 12 said they'd consider us IF we had [specific capability]
- Recurring theme: they want [X], we offer [Y] → gap
- Quote from Interview #4: "We'd pay 3x what SMBs pay, but we need..."

**Competitor data:**
- Company A has 40% of enterprise market but growing slowly
- Company B tried and failed (lessons from their case study)
- Our differentiation is real but narrow

**Financial projections:**
- Finance assumes 20% conversion on enterprise pipeline
- Historical comparison: our SMB expansion achieved 12%
- Red flag: projections might be optimistic

### Decision Log

| AI Suggestion | Decision | Reasoning |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| "Consider a partner strategy rather than direct entry" | Accepted—worth exploring | We don't have the enterprise sales team. Partnership could accelerate learning. |
| "Your product gap analysis is incomplete—check security features" | Accepted | I had focused on functionality, forgot security is table stakes for enterprise. |
| "The timing concern is overweighted—first mover advantage matters" | Rejected | AI doesn't know about our current technical debt. We can't move fast right now. |
| "Include competitor financial analysis" | Rejected | Not relevant to our decision. Would add length without insight. |

---

### Iteration Record

**Initial position:** Probably yes, looks like a good opportunity.

**After reading interviews:** More hesitant. The gap between what they want and what we have is bigger than I thought.

**After competitor analysis:** Slightly more optimistic. Competitors have gaps too. We're not as far behind as I feared.

**After stress-testing with AI:** Revised approach. Not a full "enter the market" but a "structured pilot" recommendation. AI's suggestion about partnership got me thinking about how to de-risk this.

**Final position:** Recommend a limited pilot with 3 design partners before committing to full entry. If pilot succeeds, enter. If not, we've learned cheaply.

---

## Authenticity Review Canvas

### Ownership Check

- [x] **Can I defend every major claim?** Yes. I know where every data point comes from. I can explain my reasoning in the meeting.

- [x] **Is this genuinely my thinking?** Yes. AI challenged me and helped me see blind spots, but the recommendation is mine.

- [x] **Would I present this as my work?** Absolutely. This is what I actually think.

- [x] **Did I learn something?** Yes—I updated my view on partnership strategies. I also got better at stress-testing assumptions.

- [x] **Could I recreate the core without AI?** Yes. It would take longer, but I could produce a similar analysis.

### Red Flag Check

- [ ] **Just validating robot opinions?** No. I rejected AI suggestions when they didn't fit our situation.

- [ ] **Lost engagement somewhere critical?** No. I read all primary sources myself.

- [ ] **Became a "middle manager for thoughts"?** No. I built the argument structure myself.

- [ ] **Outsourcing to avoid effort?** No. The hard parts (reading interviews, making the recommendation) I did myself.

*No red flags. Work is complete.*

---

## Final Reflection

This took about 8 hours total—maybe 2 hours more than if I'd just asked AI to draft something.

But the difference in quality is huge. I actually understand this market now. I can answer questions in the presentation. I know where my recommendation is strong and where it's a judgment call.

The decision log was surprisingly useful. Writing down why I rejected AI suggestions made me articulate my reasoning. That will help in the meeting.

The pilot recommendation wasn't my original idea—it came from stress-testing with AI. But it's genuinely what I think is right now. The challenge improved my thinking.

---

## The Memo (Summary)

*[The actual memo would follow. Executive summary:]*

**Recommendation:** Pursue enterprise market through a structured pilot with 3 design partners before committing to full entry.

**Key rationale:** The opportunity is real but our product gaps are significant. A pilot lets us validate demand and identify true requirements without a large commitment. If the pilot succeeds, we have evidence to justify investment. If it fails, we've learned cheaply.

**What we need to decide now:** Are we willing to commit 6 months and 2 engineers to a pilot? That's the actual decision today.
