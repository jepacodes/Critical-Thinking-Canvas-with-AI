## AI Decision Canvas: The Three Questions

### Question 1: Material Engagement

*Will this preserve my direct engagement with the work?*

- [ ] I will still read/analyze source documents myself
- [ ] I will make key decisions myself
- [ ] I will create something original (not just validate AI output)
- [ ] AI is a supplement, not a substitute

**If any boxes are unchecked, how will I redesign my approach?**

### Question 2: Productive Resistance

*Will AI challenge and help me think better?*

- [ ] AI will raise alternatives, not just confirm ideas
- [ ] AI will identify potential fallacies/blind spots
- [ ] I will need to think critically about AI output
- [ ] I can confidently reject AI suggestions

**If any boxes are unchecked, how will I reconfigure my AI use?**

### Question 3: Metacognition

*Will I develop awareness of my own thinking process?*

- [ ] I'm aware of why I accept/reject suggestions
- [ ] I understand my own reasoning process
- [ ] I'm learning about my own judgment
- [ ] I can articulate how I think about my domain

**If any boxes are unchecked, what reflection will I add?**

### My Value Add

[What do I bring that AI doesn't?]

### Domain Assessment

- [ ] This is in my domain (use AI for stress-testing)
- [ ] This is outside my domain (need heavy verification)

## Authenticity Review Canvas

### Ownership Check

- [ ] Can I defend every major claim?
- [ ] Is this genuinely my thinking?
- [ ] Would I be comfortable presenting this as my work?
- [ ] Did I learn something?
- [ ] Could I recreate the core without AI?

### Red Flag Check

- [ ] Am I just validating robot opinions?
- [ ] Did I lose engagement somewhere critical?
- [ ] Did I become a "middle manager for my thoughts"?
- [ ] Am I outsourcing thinking to avoid effort?

**If any red flags are checked, what needs to be redone?**
