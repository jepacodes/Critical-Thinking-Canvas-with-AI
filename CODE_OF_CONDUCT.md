# Code of Conduct

This project is about thinking better. The community should reflect that—thoughtful, respectful, genuinely curious.

---

## The Short Version

Be good to each other. Assume good intent. Focus on the work.

---

## What We're Building

This is a space for people who care about using AI thoughtfully—who want to stay in control of their thinking rather than outsourcing it. That takes intellectual humility and genuine curiosity.

The same qualities that make someone good at using AI well make someone good at participating in a community: listening, questioning assumptions, staying open to being wrong.

## What We Expect

**Be respectful.** You can disagree vigorously with an idea while treating the person who holds it with respect. Attack arguments, not people.

**Be curious.** If someone's view seems wrong, ask questions before assuming they're confused. Maybe they see something you don't.

**Be honest.** If you don't know something, say so. If you're speculating, flag it. Intellectual honesty is more valuable than looking smart.

**Be helpful.** When someone asks a question, try to actually help them—don't just show off what you know. Meet people where they are.

**Be patient.** Not everyone is at the same place. Someone might be struggling with concepts that are obvious to you. Help them up.

## What We Don't Accept

**Personal attacks.** Criticize ideas, not people. No insults, no name-calling, no character attacks.

**Harassment.** This includes repeated unwanted contact, threats, deliberate intimidation, and following people around the internet.

**Discrimination.** No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or any other form of discrimination. People of all backgrounds are welcome here.

**Bad faith.** Trolling, concern-trolling, sea-lioning, or participating in discussions without genuine interest in learning or contributing.

**Spam.** Don't use this project to promote unrelated products or services.

## When Things Go Wrong

If you see behavior that violates this code of conduct, or if you experience something that makes you uncomfortable:

1. **If it's minor:** Consider addressing it directly and kindly. Sometimes people don't realize how they're coming across.

2. **If it's serious or ongoing:** Report it to the maintainers by [opening an issue or emailing the maintainers]. Include as much context as you can.

3. **If you're targeted:** You don't have to respond or engage. Remove yourself from the situation and report it.

---

## Enforcement

Maintainers will review reports and take appropriate action. This might include:

- A friendly note that something crossed a line
- A warning that continued behavior will have consequences
- Temporary or permanent bans from the project

We'll try to handle things proportionally. Minor issues get minor responses. Serious issues get serious ones.

---

## The Spirit of the Thing

We're trying to build something useful for people who care about thinking well. That requires a community where people can engage honestly, disagree respectfully, and help each other get better.

If you're here in good faith, trying to contribute and learn, you're welcome.
