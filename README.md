# AI Proper Use Workbook

If you've ever caught yourself asking ChatGPT to summarize an article you haven't actually read, or letting AI draft an email you barely skim before sending—this workbook is for you.

It's easy to let AI do the thinking. That's sort of the point of it, right? But there's a cost. When we outsource our thinking, we stop developing our judgment. We lose touch with our own expertise. We become, as researcher Advait Sarkar puts it, "middle managers for our own thoughts."

This workbook is a set of tools to help you use AI *without* giving up the thinking that makes your work actually yours.

## What this is (and isn't)

**What it is:** An interactive canvas based on Sarkar's "Tools for Thought" framework. They help you pause before using AI and ask whether you're about to enhance your thinking or replace it.

**What it isn't:** A prohibition on AI use. A lecture about doing things the hard way. A claim that AI is bad.

The goal isn't to use AI less. It's to use it in ways that make you think *more*, not less. Sometimes that means using AI differently. Sometimes it means doing part of the work yourself first. Sometimes it means asking AI for challenges instead of answers.

## Credit where it's due

This workbook is based entirely on [Advait Sarkar's](https://advait.org) research and his TED talk, "[How to Stop AI from Killing Your Critical Thinking](https://www.ted.com/talks/advait_sarkar_how_to_stop_ai_from_killing_your_critical_thinking)." The framework, the three questions, the core insights—all of it comes from his work at Microsoft Research.

I just turned it into an interactive format. The thinking is his.
