# AI Proper Use Workbook

If you've ever caught yourself asking ChatGPT to summarize an article you haven't actually read, or letting AI draft an email you barely skim before sending—this workbook is for you.

It's easy to let AI do the thinking. That's sort of the point of it, right? But there's a cost. When we outsource our thinking, we stop developing our judgment. We lose touch with our own expertise. We become, as researcher Advait Sarkar puts it, "middle managers for our own thoughts."

This workbook is a set of tools to help you use AI *without* giving up the thinking that makes your work actually yours.

## What this is (and isn't)

**What it is:** A collection of interactive canvases based on Sarkar's "Tools for Thought" framework. They help you pause before using AI and ask whether you're about to enhance your thinking or replace it.

**What it isn't:** A prohibition on AI use. A lecture about doing things the hard way. A claim that AI is bad.

The goal isn't to use AI less. It's to use it in ways that make you think *more*, not less. Sometimes that means using AI differently. Sometimes it means doing part of the work yourself first. Sometimes it means asking AI for challenges instead of answers.

## The Three Questions

Before using AI on any task, the framework asks you to consider three things:

**1. Material Engagement:** Will you still engage directly with the source material? Or will you only see AI's interpretation of it?

**2. Productive Resistance:** Will AI challenge your thinking? Or just confirm what you already believe?

**3. Metacognition:** Will you stay aware of your own reasoning process? Or will you just accept whatever AI produces?

If you can answer "yes" to all three, you're probably using AI well. If not, the canvases help you redesign your approach.

## What's in the workbook

The workbook has six canvases, each for a different purpose:

- **AI Decision Canvas** — The Three Questions in detail. Use this when you're about to start a task with AI.
- **Task Analysis Canvas** — Helps you think clearly about what you're actually trying to do.
- **Strategic Engagement Canvas** — Map which parts need deep thinking vs. where AI can help more.
- **Thought Architecture Canvas** — Build external structures that preserve your engagement.
- **Authenticity Review Canvas** — Before you finish, check that the work is genuinely yours.
- **Implementation Tracker** — A 3-week plan to make this your default way of working.

## Getting started

1. **[Open the workbook](src/index.html)** in any browser. No installation needed.
2. Start with the **AI Decision Canvas** and work through the Three Questions for a real task.
3. Your work saves automatically in your browser. You can also export it to keep a copy.

That's it. No setup, no accounts, no tracking.

If you want to go deeper into the thinking behind this, see the [Framework Principles](docs/FRAMEWORK_PRINCIPLES.md) doc. Or just start using it and see what you notice.

## Why this matters

There's a real risk that we're entering an era where we have powerful thinking tools but weaker thinkers. Not because AI is bad, but because we use it in ways that bypass our own cognition.

This matters most for knowledge workers—people whose job *is* to think. Writers, analysts, researchers, strategists. When we let AI do our thinking, we're not just being lazy. We're atrophying the skills that make us valuable.

But it also matters for everyone. Critical thinking, judgment, the ability to read something closely and form your own view—these aren't just job skills. They're how we participate meaningfully in the world.

This workbook won't solve that. It's just a set of questions and frameworks that help you catch yourself before you outsource something you shouldn't.

## Credit where it's due

This workbook is based entirely on [Advait Sarkar's](https://advait.org) research and his TED talk, "[How to Stop AI from Killing Your Critical Thinking](https://www.ted.com/talks/advait_sarkar_how_to_stop_ai_from_killing_your_critical_thinking)." The framework, the three questions, the core insights—all of it comes from his work at Microsoft Research.

I just turned it into an interactive format. The thinking is his.
