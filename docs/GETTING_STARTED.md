# Getting Started

So you want to use AI without letting it do your thinking for you. Good. Here's how to start.

## Before you begin

This workbook isn't about using AI less. It's about using it in a way that keeps you in the driver's seat. The goal is simple: after using AI, you should understand your work *better* than before, not worse.

If you've ever finished an AI-assisted task and realized you couldn't really explain what you produced, this framework is designed to prevent that.

## Your first walkthrough

Start with the **AI Decision Canvas**—that's the first tab. It contains the Three Questions that form the core of this framework.

Here's what to do:

### Pick a real task

Don't do this abstractly. Think of something you're actually about to use AI for. Maybe you need to write a report, analyze some data, draft a proposal, or summarize a document. Something real.

### Work through Question 1: Material Engagement

This question asks: *Will you still engage directly with the source material?*

Go through each checkbox honestly:

- **Will I read the source documents myself?** If you're planning to ask AI to summarize something you haven't looked at, that's a "no."
  
- **Will I make key decisions myself?** If AI is going to decide what's important and what to include, that's a "no."

- **Will I create something original?** If your role is just to edit what AI produces, you might be in trouble here.

- **Is AI a supplement, not a substitute?** This is the core question. Is AI helping you do your work, or is it doing your work while you watch?

If you can't check these boxes, don't proceed with AI the way you planned. Redesign your approach first.

### Work through Question 2: Productive Resistance

This question asks: *Will AI challenge your thinking?*

Here's where a lot of people go wrong. They use AI for confirmation rather than challenge. They ask AI to support their existing ideas rather than stress-test them.

Think about how you're prompting AI:

- Are you asking for alternatives?
- Are you asking it to find holes in your reasoning?
- Are you prepared to reject its suggestions?

If AI is just going to agree with you, it's not making you think better.

### Work through Question 3: Metacognition

This question asks: *Will you stay aware of your own thinking process?*

This is the subtlest question. It's about whether you can articulate *why* you accept or reject what AI gives you.

When you review AI output, do you notice what you're thinking? Or do you just accept things that "sound right"?

## What good looks like

Let me give you an example of doing this well.

**The task:** Write a quarterly analysis of customer feedback trends.

**Without the framework:** You dump all the feedback into ChatGPT and ask for a summary with recommendations. You skim what it produces, make a few edits, and send it.

**With the framework:**

- You read through the feedback yourself first, noting patterns you see
- You use AI to check if you missed any themes
- When AI suggests a pattern, you go back to the source data to verify it
- You write the core analysis yourself, using AI to help with structure
- When AI makes a recommendation, you evaluate whether it actually makes sense for your situation
- You can explain every major claim in the final document

In the first approach, you produced something. In the second approach, you actually understood something.

## If you get stuck

**Can't check the boxes honestly?** That's valuable information. It means your planned approach would bypass too much of your own thinking. Redesign it. Maybe you need to do some parts yourself before bringing AI in.

**Not sure what counts?** The key question is always: *Am I thinking, or am I just validating?* If you're genuinely evaluating what AI produces—questioning it, comparing it to your own understanding, deciding whether it's right—you're thinking. If you're just accepting what sounds good, you're validating.

**Finding this tedious?** It gets faster. The Three Questions become instinctive after a while. You won't need the workbook for every task—just for important ones or when you notice yourself slipping into passive mode.

## Next steps

After you've done the AI Decision Canvas for one task:

1. If you want to go deeper on a complex task, try the **Task Analysis Canvas**—it helps you get clearer about what you're actually trying to do.

2. If you want to map out exactly how you'll engage with different parts of the work, try the **Strategic Engagement Canvas**.

3. If you want to build artifacts that keep you engaged throughout a project, try the **Thought Architecture Canvas**.

4. Before you finalize important work, run through the **Authenticity Review Canvas**.

5. If you want to make this a lasting habit, use the **Implementation Tracker** for a 3-week practice program.

## One more thing

This framework isn't about purity. It's not saying "never let AI do anything substantial."

It's about making conscious choices. About knowing when you're trading thinking for convenience, and deciding whether that trade is worth it.

Sometimes it is. Sometimes you just need something done, and thinking deeply about it isn't valuable.

But for work that matters—work that develops your judgment, builds your expertise, or carries real stakes—the thinking is the point. Don't outsource that.
