# User Guide

This guide walks through each canvas in detail. Not just what to fill in, but why it matters and what good responses look like.

## The Canvases

The workbook has six canvases. You don't need to use all of them for every task. Here's how they relate:

- **AI Decision Canvas** — The core. Use this every time.
- **Task Analysis Canvas** — Use when you need clarity about what you're doing.
- **Strategic Engagement Canvas** — Use for complex tasks where you need to map out engagement.
- **Thought Architecture Canvas** — Use for projects where you need to build external thinking structures.
- **Authenticity Review Canvas** — Use before finalizing important work.
- **Implementation Tracker** — Use once, to build the habit.

## Canvas 1: AI Decision Canvas

This is the heart of the framework. The Three Questions.

### Question 1: Material Engagement

**What it's asking:** Will you maintain direct contact with the actual material, or will you only experience AI's interpretation of it?

**Why it matters:** When you read a document, you notice things. You make connections. You form impressions. When you only read AI's summary, you only get what AI thought was important. You lose the texture, the nuance, the unexpected insight.

**What good looks like:**

*Weak response:* "Yes, I'll read some of the documents."

*Strong response:* "I'll read all the primary sources myself. I'll use AI to help me organize my notes, but I'll do the reading and initial analysis. AI won't see the documents until I've formed my own view."

**Common mistakes:**

- Planning to "review" AI's summary without reading the originals
- Letting AI filter what you see before you've seen it yourself
- Checking the box because you'll technically look at AI's output

### Question 2: Productive Resistance

**What it's asking:** Will AI push back on your thinking, or just execute your requests?

**Why it matters:** The value of a thinking partner isn't agreement—it's challenge. If AI just does what you ask without questioning whether it makes sense, it's a tool, not a collaborator. And if you're not being challenged, you're not improving your thinking.

**What good looks like:**

*Weak response:* "I'll ask AI for feedback on my draft."

*Strong response:* "I'll explicitly ask AI to find problems with my reasoning. I'll prompt it to argue against my conclusions. When it suggests something, I'll ask why, and I'll decide whether I actually agree."

**Common mistakes:**

- Using AI for validation ("Does this sound good?") instead of challenge ("What's wrong with this?")
- Accepting AI suggestions that "sound right" without evaluating them
- Getting frustrated when AI pushes back, instead of engaging with it

### Question 3: Metacognition

**What it's asking:** Will you stay aware of your own thinking process?

**Why it matters:** If you can't explain why you accepted or rejected something, you're not really thinking—you're just reacting. Metacognition is what separates considered judgment from gut response.

**What good looks like:**

*Weak response:* "I'll think carefully about what AI produces."

*Strong response:* "I'll keep a decision log. For each major AI suggestion, I'll write down whether I accepted or rejected it and why. I'll notice when I'm accepting things because they sound right vs. because I've actually evaluated them."

**Common mistakes:**

- Confusing "I thought about it" with "I was aware of my thinking process"
- Not being able to articulate why you made particular choices
- Losing track of which ideas came from you vs. from AI

## Canvas 2: Task Analysis Canvas

This canvas helps you get clear on what you're actually trying to accomplish. Sounds obvious, but it's remarkable how often we start tasks without this clarity.

### What's the Goal?

Don't write the task name. Write what success looks like.

*Weak:* "Write quarterly report."

*Strong:* "Explain to leadership why customer satisfaction dropped in Q3, identify the root causes, and recommend specific actions we should take in Q4. They should finish reading feeling like they understand the problem and have a clear path forward."

### What Materials Do I Need?

This is about identifying your source material—the stuff you need to actually engage with.

*Weak:* "Customer feedback data."

*Strong:* "All customer survey responses from Q3 (847 responses). Support ticket themes from the past quarter. Exit interviews from churned customers. Competitor analysis from product team. Previous quarter's report for comparison."

### What Decisions Must I Make?

These are the judgment calls that require your expertise, values, or context.

*Weak:* "What to include in the report."

*Strong:* "Which issues to prioritize—there are more problems than we can fix, so I need to decide which matter most. How to frame sensitive issues for leadership. Whether to recommend short-term fixes or push for systemic changes. How honest to be about internal failures."

### My Value Add

This is what you bring that AI can't.

*Weak:* "My experience."

*Strong:* "I know our customers personally. I understand the internal politics around this issue. I've seen what happens when we try quick fixes vs. addressing root causes. I know which leaders will be receptive to what kinds of recommendations."

### Domain Assessment

Be honest about whether this is in your area of expertise. The approach should be different.

**In your domain:** Use AI as a junior colleague. Ask for alternatives, stress-test ideas, but keep authority over decisions. Be skeptical when AI suggests something that contradicts your expertise.

**Outside your domain:** Use AI to learn, not to shortcut learning. Verify everything carefully. You won't be able to spot mistakes easily. Engage more deeply with source material. Get human expert validation for important things.

## Canvas 3: Strategic Engagement Canvas

This canvas helps you map which parts of a task need deep engagement and which can be more AI-assisted.

### Deep Engagement (Red Zone)

This is where the real thinking happens. Where you need to be fully present.

*Example:* "Reading the primary research papers. Forming my initial thesis. Making the final recommendation. Writing the executive summary. Any part that requires judgment about what matters."

### Moderate Engagement (Yellow Zone)

Collaborative work. You're still thinking, but AI is more involved.

*Example:* "Finding supporting evidence for points I've already identified. Exploring counter-arguments to my position. Checking my logic for gaps. Getting alternative framings I might have missed."

### Light Engagement (Green Zone)

AI handles more of the work. You're supervising, not creating.

*Example:* "Formatting and structure. Grammar and clarity edits. Generating boilerplate sections like methodology descriptions. Adjusting tone for the audience."

### AI Guardrails

Set explicit boundaries for what AI should and shouldn't do.

**What AI Should Do:**

*Example:* "Challenge my assumptions. Point out when my reasoning doesn't follow. Suggest alternatives I haven't considered. Help me see how others might react to my recommendations."

**What AI Should NOT Do:**

*Example:* "Write the core argument without my direction. Make recommendations I haven't evaluated myself. Summarize sources I haven't read yet. Replace my judgment with its own."

## Canvas 4: Thought Architecture Canvas

This canvas is about building external structures that keep you engaged.

### Why External Structures Matter

When you work in your head and AI works in the chat, things blur. You lose track of which ideas were yours. You can't tell when you've drifted from thinking to accepting.

External structures—outlines, notes, logs—create anchors. They're proof of your thinking. They make it obvious when AI's suggestions don't fit your framework.

### Outline / Mind Map

Build your structure before involving AI.

*Example:* "Main argument: Customer satisfaction dropped because of three issues. Issue 1: Product stability problems after the June release. Issue 2: Support response times increased. Issue 3: Pricing changes alienated mid-tier customers. Recommendations: Short-term fixes for stability, long-term investment in support, pricing reconsideration for renewals."

### Source Grounding

Track where ideas come from.

*Example:* "Survey data shows stability is the #1 complaint (47% of negative responses). Support ticket analysis shows average response time went from 4 hours to 18 hours. Exit interviews specifically mention feeling 'nickel and dimed' on the new pricing—see quotes from customers A, B, C."

### Decision Log

Document your judgments.

*Example:* "AI suggested adding a section on competitor comparison. Rejected—not relevant to our goal and would distract from the core message. AI recommended a more aggressive tone about the pricing issue. Accepted partially—the facts are damning enough, but I don't want to sound accusatory toward the team that made those decisions."

### Annotations

Your notes on source material.

*Example:* "Customer quote from survey: 'I used to recommend you to everyone. Now I tell people to wait and see.' This captures the sentiment perfectly—use in intro. Ticket #4521 is a good example of the support delay problem—customer waited 3 days for a simple answer."

### Iteration Record

How your thinking evolved.

*Example:* "Initially thought pricing was the main issue. After reading support tickets, realized stability problems came first and pricing just made frustrated customers leave faster. Changed the structure to lead with product stability."

## Canvas 5: Authenticity Review Canvas

Use this before you finalize important work.

### Ownership Check

These should all be honestly "yes":

- **Can I defend every major claim?** Not "did I read it somewhere" but "could I explain this in a meeting without notes?"

- **Is this genuinely my thinking?** Would you have reached similar conclusions doing this without AI?

- **Would I present this as my work?** Not legally—ethically. Is this what you actually think?

- **Did I learn something?** Did the process improve your understanding?

- **Could I recreate the core without AI?** If the AI disappeared, could you produce something similar?

### Red Flag Check

Any of these being true is a problem:

- **Just validating robot opinions?** Did you actually evaluate, or just accept what sounded good?

- **Lost engagement somewhere critical?** Is there a part you don't really understand?

- **Became a "middle manager for thoughts"?** Were you delegating and approving rather than thinking?

- **Outsourced to avoid effort?** Did you let AI handle something because you didn't want to do the work?

If any red flags are checked, go back and redo those parts.

## Canvas 6: Implementation Tracker

Use this once to build the habit.

### Week 1: Awareness

The goal isn't to change anything yet. Just notice.

- When do you reach for AI?
- When do you disengage?
- What are your riskiest habits?

### Week 2: Redesign

Pick three regular tasks. Redesign how you do them.

Use the Strategic Engagement Canvas to map out where you need to think deeply.

Test the new workflows.

### Week 3: Refinement

Based on what you learned:

- What worked?
- What needs adjustment?
- What are your personal rules going forward?

### After Week 3

The Three Questions should be instinctive now. You don't need the full workbook for routine tasks—just for important ones or when you notice yourself slipping.

## Tips

**Don't fill in everything.** Use the canvases that help. Skip what doesn't apply.

**Be specific.** Generic responses don't help. "I'll think critically" means nothing. "I'll verify the three main claims against the original data" means something.

**Be honest.** The only person you're fooling is yourself. If you can't check a box honestly, don't check it.

**Revisit.** Come back to your responses later. Did you actually do what you said you would?
