# Assets

This directory contains static assets for the workbook.

## Structure

- `icons/` - Icon files (if we add any beyond emoji)
- `images/` - Image files (screenshots, diagrams, etc.)

## Current Status

The workbook currently uses emoji for icons, which means no external icon files are needed. This keeps things simple and avoids extra HTTP requests.

If we add custom icons or images in the future, they should go here.

## Guidelines

- Keep file sizes small (optimize images)
- Use descriptive file names
- Prefer SVG for icons (scalable, small file size)
- Include alt text in HTML when adding images
