# Contributing to the AI Proper Use Workbook

Thanks for considering contributing. Genuinely.

This project exists because someone took Advait Sarkar's ideas and made them into something interactive. If you want to make it better—whether that's fixing a typo, improving accessibility, adding a new canvas, or rewriting the docs because they're unclear—that's exactly how open source should work.

## Ways you can contribute

### Small things that matter
- **Fix typos or unclear language.** If something confused you, it probably confuses others too.
- **Report bugs.** If something doesn't work, let us know.
- **Improve accessibility.** Screen reader issues, keyboard navigation problems, contrast issues—these matter a lot.
- **Test on different devices/browsers.** If it breaks somewhere, we want to know.

### Bigger things
- **Add new canvases or features.** If you've used the framework and developed something useful, share it.
- **Write case studies.** Real examples of how people use this are incredibly valuable.
- **Translate the workbook.** If you can make it accessible to more people, that's huge.
- **Improve the code.** Better organization, cleaner CSS, more robust JavaScript—all welcome.

### Things you're not sure about
Just open an issue. Describe what you're thinking, and we'll figure out together whether it makes sense.

## How to contribute

### For documentation or content changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request with a description of what you changed and why

For small changes (typos, wording), just go ahead. For larger changes, it might be worth opening an issue first to discuss.

### For code changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Test in at least Chrome and Firefox
4. Check that keyboard navigation still works
5. Submit a pull request

The codebase is intentionally simple—vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There's no build step. If you open `src/index.html` in a browser, it should just work.

### For new features or canvases

Open an issue first. Describe:
- What problem this solves
- How it fits with the existing framework
- Any open questions you have

We can discuss before you put in the work. Sometimes an idea sounds good but doesn't fit, and it's better to figure that out early.

## Code guidelines

This isn't a strict project. There's no linter config or style guide to memorize. But here's the spirit of how the code should work:

**Readability over cleverness.** Someone should be able to read the code and understand what it does without deep study. Avoid abstractions that don't earn their complexity.

**Comments should explain *why*, not *what*.** The code shows what's happening. Comments should explain decisions that aren't obvious from the code itself.

**Keep it simple.** No frameworks, no build step, no unnecessary dependencies. This should work by opening an HTML file in a browser, forever.

**Accessibility matters.** Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, visible focus states. Not as a compliance checkbox, but because people actually need these things.

## What happens when you submit a PR

Someone will review it. We're not trying to gatekeep—we're trying to make sure changes improve the project.

For small fixes, review is quick. For bigger changes, there might be discussion. Don't take it personally if we ask questions or suggest changes. It's part of the process.

If you haven't heard anything in a week, ping the PR. Sometimes things slip through the cracks.

## Questions?

Open an issue. That's the right place for questions about contributing, about the framework, or about whether a particular change makes sense.
